The task is done using pure HTML, CSS and a little bit of jQuery for animations and sliders. I din't use any JavaScript libraries like React or Vue, although I am able to do the same task using one of these, as well as Laravel, and a CSS pre-processor like Sass.

I didn't have access to Helvetica font because it is a paid font, therefore I replaced it with a different one.
